	 Q. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	 A. Snippets are a very nice way to improve the coding experience. Any redundant code that becomes tedious would be great ways to incorporate snippets. I expect to use them more often, however, I will be hesitant to use them too much to make sure I fully understand why I'm timing during the learning experience. 

	 Q. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
