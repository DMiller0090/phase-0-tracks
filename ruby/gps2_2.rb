# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # take string and split at each space and store into an array
  # iterate through array, pushing each value as a key into a hash and 
  # 	assign default quantity as the associated value pair (default quantity will be 1)
  # print the list to the console [can you use one of your other methods here?]
# output: hash

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: hash, item name, and optional quantity
# steps: take item name as key for hash, and set associated value as quantity
  # if quantity isn't specified, set quantity to default (default = 1)
  # put key-value pair to the end of the hash
# output: hash

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: hash and item name as a string
# steps: delete item in hash at item name specified at input
# output: hash

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: hash, item name, and new quantity
# steps: iterate through hash, if a key is equal to the item name in parameter,
  # set value equal to quantity
  # if key is not present in hash, return nil
# output: hash or nil

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: hash
# steps: iterate through hash, printing off key and value
# output: nil

# Q/A

# What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
	# Implementation shouldn't be apart of the pseudocode, keep it simple and to the point.
# What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
	# Hashes are great for easy access of data. Arrays seem to be easier to work with for manipulation.
# What does a method return?
	# The last operation ran in the method
# What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
	# Any object (strings, integers, arrays, hashes, classes, etc.)
# How can you pass information between methods?
	# Passing returns to parameters, or by passing parameters to other parameters
# What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
	# Psuedocoding and procedures for asking questions to the guide were solidified this GPS.
